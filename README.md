# Determinant-Solver

In a bid to translate a little machine learning maths into javascript, I thought I'd start off by making a program that solves any nxn determinant via recursion. To break it down a little further it:

1. Takes an nxn array.
2. Performs a bunch of error checks to validate input.
3. If no errors are returned it passes the array into a function that performs the calculation.

Mindblowing stuff
